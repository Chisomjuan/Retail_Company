This is retail company's sales analysis done using Excel

## Introduction

In this analysis, I examined the sales data of a retail company to uncover key insights that can drive business decisions. Using Excel, I calculated the sum of revenue segmented by gender, country, and age band. I employed IF statements to categorize customers into different age bands and to determine customer value. This analysis provides a clear understanding of revenue distribution across various demographics, helping to identify high-value customer segments and regional performance.

## Problem Statement

The retail company aims to enhance its sales strategy by better understanding its customer demographics and revenue distribution. However, the current sales data lacks clear segmentation and insights into key factors such as gender, country, and age. Without this information, the company struggles to identify high-value customer segments, optimize marketing efforts, and tailor product offerings to meet customer needs.

To address this, the sales data needs to be analyzed using Excel to calculate the sum of revenue by gender, country, and age band. By employing IF statements to categorize customers into age bands and determine customer value, with aim to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making and improve overall sales performance.
